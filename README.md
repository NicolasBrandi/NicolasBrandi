I'm a biomedical engineer who is passionate about technology in the medical world and research in developing new techniques. I worked in the MRI service developing software and researching into new diagnosis imaging methods and their numerous potentials. 

Another interest of mine is web development specifically designing websites and applications for the medical field and services. Some of the technologies I enjoy working with are Python, 3D-Slicer, JS, CSS & HTML.
